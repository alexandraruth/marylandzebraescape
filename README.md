# The Great Maryland Zebra Escape of 2021

In September 2021, a dazzle of zebras (or a zeal of zebras, depending on your plural noun preference!) was reported in Prince George's County in Maryland. The reported count of zebras on the loose increased over several days. As of today (9/18) the zebras are still at large.
