# The Great Maryland Zebra Escape of 2021

In September 2021, a dazzle of zebras was reported in Prince George's County in Maryland. The reported count of zebras on the loose increased over several days. As of today (9/20) the zebras are still at large. The code in this repository plots the increasing reported zebra count from media outlets.

NOTE: Reported zebra counts by day does not refer to the ACTUAL count of escaped zebras for that day - all zebras are believed to have escaped at the same time, but so far the total count *reported* has gone up to six.
